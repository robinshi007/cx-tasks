1. As a user, I want to see the tasks is organize by section in the backlog page.

- The tasks is organize/grouped by section in backlog page
- The section can be created by click the button at the right of the toolbar.
- The task can be created by click the button at the bottom of each section.
- The task can be drag and drop to each section
- The tasks can be filter by key word search, cancel the search filter by click the close icon at the search box
- The tasks can be filter by pre-defined filter "Assigned to me" and "Due this week"
  "Assigned to me": Displays issues assigned to the person who is currently viewing this board.
  "Due this week": Displays issues that due date belongs to this week.
- The tasks can be grouped by "Section" and "Assignee".
- The tasks can be sorted by "Due date" and "Assignee"
