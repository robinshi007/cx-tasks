1. As a user, I want to get the all summary infos around me after I logged in.

- "My work" subnav is activated by default at "CxTasks" tab after I logged in.
- "Recent projects" card list shows the projects I visited, sort by access time, limited to 5
- "Worked on" shows my current working tasks(the tasks assigned to me that not in "To Do"),
  limited to 10 with "see more" link
- "Assigned to me" shows the tasks assigned to me(in "To Do"), limited to 10 with "see more" link
