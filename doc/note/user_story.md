## What is a User Story?

User Stories are one of the core elements of the Agile methodology.

User Story is a small (actually, the smallest) piece of work that represents some value to an end user and can be delivered during a sprint.

The main aim of this element is to put end users in the center of conversation and capture product functionality from their perspective. Thus, developers get a better understanding of what, for whom and why they’re building.

Great User Stories always fit the INVEST set of criteria by Bill Wake:

- Independent – they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don’t affect the others.
- Negotiable – it’s up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.
- Valuable – each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.
- Estimable – it’s quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.
- Small – it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.
- Testable – there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.

The User Story format is quite plain and short:

`As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]`

## How to Write User Stories: Our Workflow

User stories are mainly written by Product Owners since it’s their responsibility to keep the Backlog filled with tasks

A Story-writing meeting is usually held near the start of the project.

Later on, we’re able to use our Scrum User Story list to prepare more detailed estimates, prioritize feature development for sprints and so on.

we supplement the original list as we work on a project with new stories to stay up-to-date with our client’s requirements

we specific workflow that helps us deliver the best Stories:

- Make up the list of your end users. Define what their “pain” or “need” is, which you’re trying to solve.
- Define what actions they may want to take.
- Find out what value this will bring to users and, eventually, to your product. Also ask yourself - will any party pay us for this?
- Discuss acceptance criteria and an optimal implementation strategy.

An acceptance criteria is a set of conditions that are used to confirm when a Story is completed.

Step 1: Think of the “Who”
Who are the end users of your product, what needs they have, which you are trying to cover.

Step 2: Think of the “What”
Define what functionality each user expects, how he’s going to interact with the app

Step 3: Think of the “Why”
Your [so that] section should always correspond with your metrics and KPIs.
It should either improve the UX, increase retention rates,
shorten users’ journey to the issue solution or whatever.

Step 4: Discuss a Story
Finally, we always discuss User Stories after they’ve been created.
During this Q&A session, we ask the author of the Story to provide more details or clarify something if needed.
It helps us understand how it should work and agree on acceptance criteria.
Then we hold a brainstorming session with the whole team working on the project.
It allows us to find out the best ways to implement User Stories from the tech perspective.

We also uses the following tips when working on this task:

- Start with Epics. It’s usually easier to move from more complex tasks to more specific ones so try writing Epics and then split them into Stories.
- Listen to feedback. Sometimes you don’t need to guess Stories - ask your real end users for feedback and use their ideas as a source of inspiration.
- Don’t introduce details too early. It’s better to hold the brainstorming session before each sprint to discuss how to implement planned Stories.

## Conclusion

User Stories can help you to constantly improve the value of your product,
estimate development efforts in an appropriate way and prioritize feature development during the MVP and post-MVP stages.
